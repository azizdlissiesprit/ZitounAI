# Trained models

Weights are **not in Git**. They are shared through one private Hugging Face model repo, with the same folders as here. `docker-compose.yml` mounts this folder read-only into each AI container at `/models`.

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
# in .env: HF_MODELS_REPO=<user-or-org>/zitouna-models and HF_TOKEN=hf_... (huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
python scripts/models.py list                 # what is on the Hub
python scripts/models.py pull                 # download everything into models/
python scripts/models.py push m5_ensemble     # module owner: upload after (re)training
docker compose restart                        # the services load the new weights at startup
```

To give teammates access to the private repo, create a free Hugging Face **organization**, move the repo into it (`HF_MODELS_REPO=<org>/zitouna-models`) and invite them; each one uses their own token.

If a file is missing, the service runs in mock mode (`"mock": true`). Put the model version (e.g. the MLflow run id) in the `MODEL_VERSION` environment variable.
